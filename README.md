# ProportionsCheck
ProportionsCheck is a simple android app that helps artists working on physical mediums check their artwork
by showing a flipped image along the vertical axis. 

Among artists, it is a well known problem that staring at one's drawing too long can cause the brain to subconsciously "fix" it.
Proportion errors and distortions become less and less noticeable as they draw, which can lead to the artist deluding themselves
as to how good the drawing actually looks.

Luckily the solution is simply: mirror the drawing. Flipping the drawing along the vertical axis "resets" the brain and forces it to look at the drawing as though it's the first time the artist has seen it. Suddenly huge inaccuracies and errors become painfully obvious.

The problem is that it can be difficult to mirror a traditional drawing. For a digital drawing, mirroring is trivially easy, but flipping a physical drawing requires either shining light through the back of the paper or a mirror setup of some kind. The point is, it can be annoying.

That's where ProportionsCheck comes in. It's a simple app that boots up quickly because it only has one function. It just flips what
the phone camera sees. This makes it very easy to quickly check how the image you're drawing really looks.
